title: Developing Firmware

<h1>Developing Firmware</h1>

<p>You'll need a toolchain that supports ARM Cortex-M3.  The Makefiles in
Project Ubertooth are designed for GCC and a Linux-based toolchain, such as the
free installation provided by <a
href="http://www.codesourcery.com/">Codesourcery</a>, but it should be possible
to compile firmware with any development environment for the Cortex-M3.</p>

<p>Although firmware source can be found in the release downloads, you will
probably want fresh code from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubertooth/develop">svn</a>.</p>
