<h1>Project Ubertooth</h1>

<p><em>an open source 2.4 GHz wireless development platform suitable for
Bluetooth experimentation</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the project site and documentation for Project Ubertooth.  Here
you can learn how to build, use, and develop for the Ubertooth hardware
platforms:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="hardware/zero">Ubertooth Zero</a>, a low power (comparable to
	a Class 3 Bluetooth device) USB dongle.</li>
	<li><a href="hardware/one">Ubertooth One</a>, a smaller, higher power
	(comparable to a Class 1 Bluetooth device) USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ubertooth One is intended to be the preferred platform in the near future
but is still untested.</p>

<p>Demonstration software is available that implements passive Basic Rate
Bluetooth monitoring integrated into <a
href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a>.  With additional software
development, many other functions will become possible, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bluetooth Basic Rate injection</li>
	<li>Bluetooth Low Energy monitoring and injection</li>
	<li>802.11 FHSS monitoring and injection</li>
	<li>basic spectrum monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ubertooth hardware architecture is not compatible with Bluetooth
Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) modulations.  However, EDR packets begin with a Basic
Rate (1 Mbps GFSK) header, so Ubertooth could be used for identification and
partial monitoring of EDR transmissions.</p>
