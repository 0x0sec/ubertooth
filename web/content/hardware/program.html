<h1>Programming</h1>

<p>This page describes how to load firmware onto an Ubertooth One or Ubertooth
Zero.  Other pages describe how to write <a
href="/firmware/develop">firmware</a> or <a href="/host/develop">host code</a>
for the platform.</p>

<p>There are three ways to program an Ubertooth board: the USB bootloader, the
ISP bootloader, and JTAG.</p>

<h2>USB bootloader</h2>

<p>This will probably be the preferred method to load code onto an Ubertooth
Zero or Ubertooth One in the future, but there is no USB bootloader yet.  This
method will only work for Ubertooth boards that have had the USB bootloader
firmware previously installed.  For a newly constructed device without
firmware, one of the other two programming methods is required.</p>

<h2>ISP bootloader</h2>

<p>The LPC175x features an In-System Programming (ISP) bootloader that allows
code to be loaded over a serial interface.  In order to use ISP, you will need
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/">lpc21isp</a> and a 3.3V
serial programming device such as one of the following:</p>

<h3>Pogoprog</h3>

<p>The official Ubertooth ISP programmer is Pogoprog, an open source board that
can be assembled using a process similar to Ubertooth One assembly.</p>

<h3>an FTDI Basic Breakout - 3.3V</h3>

<p>You can use SparkFun's <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873">FTDI
Basic Breakout - 3.3V</a> to program an Ubertooth.  Adafruit's <a
href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=284">FTDI
Friend</a> is a similar board that should work as well.  To allow lpc21isp to
automatically activate the LPC175x's ISP bootloader, you must modify the board
in one of two ways.</p>

<h4>method one: the easy way</h4>

<p>Just short the CTS pin to GND.  This will force the microcontroller into ISP
mode every time it resets while the programmer is connected.  In order to
perform a normal reset to run the newly loaded code, you will have to first
disconnect the programmer.</p>

<h4>method two: the better way</h4>

<p>Connect the CTS pin to the RTS pin (pin 3) on the FT232RL using fine gauge
wire such as wire wrap wire.  This is trickier to solder, but it has the
advantage that the pin will be fully controlled by lpc21isp.  This means that
you can leave the programmer connected to the Ubertooth board throughout
multiple program/test cycles.</p>

<h3>Using ISP</h3>

<p>Connect your serial programmer to the Ubertooth board and type &quot;make
program&quot; in the firmware source code directory.  If you have a precompiled
binary in .hex format, you can invoke lpc21isp directly with &quot;lpc21isp
-control firmware.hex /dev/ttyUSB0 230400 4000&quot; (replacing firmware.hex
with the firmware filename and /dev/ttyUSB0 with the device file of your serial
programmer.</p>

<h2>JTAG</h2>

<p>Connect your ARM Cortex-M3 JTAG debugger (such as one supported by <a
href="http://openocd.berlios.de/web/">OpenOCD</a>) to the standard Cortex Debug
Connector on the Ubertooth One or the non-standard JTAG connector on the
Ubertooth Zero.  You know what to do.</p>
