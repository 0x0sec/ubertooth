<h1>Build Guide</h1>
<p>The Ubertooth has been used with the following platforms:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> (Debian/BackTrack 5 - untested)</li>
    <li><a href="#fedora">Fedora</a> (RedHat/CentOS - untested)</li>
    <li><a href="#windows">Windows</a> (experimental - unsupported)</li>
    <li>Mac OS X (Coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>The firmware image on the Ubertooth is normally tied to the release version
of the host code that it operates with, instructions for obtaining firmware
images and flashing them to the Ubertooth can be found <a href="#firmware">here.</a></p>

<h2 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu 12.04+</h2>
(Debian/BackTrack 5 - untested)
<br /><br />
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>There are some prerequisites that can be installed from the apt repositories
on Debian/Ubuntu systems:</p>
<pre>
    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-dev make gcc pyside-tools
</pre>

<p>PyUSB is not yet available from the apt repositories, so it must be
downloaded and built from sourece as follows:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/files/PyUSB%201.0/1.0.0-alpha-2/pyusb-1.0.0a2.tar.gz/download -O pyusb-1.0.0a2.tar.gz
    tar xvf pyusb-1.0.0a2.tar.gz
    cd pyusb-1.0.0a2
    sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

<p>Next the Bluetooth baseband library (libbtbb) needs to be built for the
Ubertooth tools to decode Bluetooth packets:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/libbtbb/files/libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz/download -O libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    tar xf libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    cd libbtbb-0.8
    make
    sudo make install
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Ubertooth tools</h3>
<p>There are three sets of tools that use the Ubertooth - spectrum analyzer,
Bluetooth sniffing tools and firmware update.  All three are built and installed
by default using the following method:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubertooth/files/ubertooth-r534.tar.gz/download -O ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    tar xf ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    cd ubertooth-r534/host/bluetooth_rxtx
    make
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Kismet</h3>
<p>The version if kismet provided by Debian/Ubuntu is 2008-05-R1, which is too 
old to support the Ubertooth plugin.  In order to use Ubertooth with Kismet it 
is nessecary to compile Kismet from source:</p>
<pre>
    sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8-dev libcap-dev libnl-dev
    wget http://www.kismetwireless.net/code/kismet-2011-03-R2.tar.gz
    tar xf kismet-2011-03-R2.tar.gz
    cd kismet-2011-03-R2
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make suidinstall
</pre>

<p>Next the Ubertooth plugin can be built from the downloaded source code</p>
<pre>
    cd ubertooth-r534/host/kismet/plugin-ubertooth
    KIS_SRC_DIR=<i>/path/to/kismet/src</i> make
    sudo make install
</pre>
<p>This completes the install of the Ubertooth tools, the next step is to
look at the <a href="../start">getting started</a> guide.  It may also be
useful to update the <a href="#firmware">firmware</a> on the Ubertooth.</p>



<h2 id="fedora">Fedora 17+</h2>
(RedHat/CentOS - untested)
<br /><br />
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>There are some prerequisites that can be installed from the yum repositories
on RedHat based systems:</p>
<pre>
    su -c "yum install libusb1-devel make gcc pyside-tools pyusb wget tar"
</pre>

<p>Next the Bluetooth baseband library (libbtbb) needs to be built for the
Ubertooth tools to decode Bluetooth packets:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/libbtbb/files/libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz/download -O libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    tar xf libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    cd libbtbb-0.8
    make
    su -c "make install"
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Ubertooth tools</h3>
<p>There are three sets of tools that use the Ubertooth - spectrum analyzer,
Bluetooth sniffing tools and firmware update.  All three are built and installed
by default using the following method:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubertooth/files/ubertooth-r534.tar.gz/download -O ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    tar xf ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    cd ubertooth-r534/host/bluetooth_rxtx
    make
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Kismet</h3>
<p>The version if kismet provided by Fedora does not have a corresponding
development package, so in order to build the Ubertooth plugin it is nessecary
to compile Kismet from source:</p>
<pre>
    su -c "yum install libpcap-devel libcap-devel libnl-devel libstdc++-devel gcc-c++ ncurses-devel"
    wget http://www.kismetwireless.net/code/kismet-2011-03-R2.tar.gz
    tar xf kismet-2011-03-R2.tar.gz
    cd kismet-2011-03-R2
    ./configure
    make
    su -c "make suidinstall"
</pre>

<p>Next the Ubertooth plugin can be built from the downloaded source code</p>
<pre>
    cd ubertooth-r534/host/kismet/plugin-ubertooth
    KIS_SRC_DIR=<i>/path/to/kismet/src</i> make
    su -c "KIS_SRC_DIR=<i>/path/to/kismet/src</i> make install"
</pre>
<p>This completes the install of the Ubertooth tools, the next step is to
look at the <a href="../start">getting started</a> guide.  It may also be
useful to update the <a href="#firmware">firmware</a> on the Ubertooth.</p>



<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>Experimental Windows support is available under Cygwin.  Although this is
unsupported.</p>
<br />

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The first step is to download Cygwin from <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">
http://cygwin.com/setup.exe</a> and install it.  When installing Cygwin, the
following tools are required:</p>
<pre>
    gcc
    automake
    python
    libusb-1.0
    libusb-1.0-dev
</pre>

<p>Libbtbb needs to be built before the Ubertooth tools, it is available from
SourceForge as follows:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/libbtbb/files/libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz/download -O libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    tar xf libbtbb-0.8.tar.gz
    cd libbtbb-0.8
    make
    make cygwin-install
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Ubertooth tools</h3>
<p>There are three sets of tools that use the Ubertooth - spectrum analyzer,
Bluetooth sniffing tools and firmware upload.  All three are built and installed
by default using the following method:</p>
<pre>
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubertooth/files/ubertooth-r534.tar.gz/download -O ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    tar xf ubertooth-r534.tar.gz
    cd ubertooth-r534/host/bluetooth_rxtx
    make
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Kismet</h3>
<p>It is not possible to build Kismet with pcap support on Windows.
Unfortunatley the Ubertooth plugin requires pcap support to function, so it
cannot currently be built on Windows.</p>

<p>This completes the install of the Ubertooth tools, the next step is to
look at the <a href="../start">getting started</a> guide.  It may also be
useful to update the <a href="#firmware">firmware</a> on the Ubertooth.</p>

<div id="firmware"></div>
<h2>Firmware</h2>
<p>Binary firmware images are available as part of the release package.  They
are specific to the version of the Ubertooth being used (Ubertooth one,
Ubertooth zero, Toorcon 13 badge).  In order to write a firmware image to a
device, it first needs to be put in to flashing mode, then the image is written
using the ubertooth-dfu tool:</p>
<pre>
    ubertooth-util -f
    ubertooth-dfu --write bluetooth_rxtx.dfu --detach
</pre>
<br />
